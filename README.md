This repo collects and tracks FFmpeg development headers accross FFmpeg versions to assist development against FFmpeg.

The first version tracked is 3.4.2. Not every released version is tracked: once a new release branch `x.y` is out, versions on older release branches are no longer tracked in order to maintain a linear history in this repo.
